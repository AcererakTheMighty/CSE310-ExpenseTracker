# Overview

This expense tracker software is a Java application designed to help users manage and analyze their financial transactions. By tracking expenditures across categories, such as food and transportation, this software enables users to monitor their spending habits effectively. Additionally, the application includes features for setting budgets and generating summary reports, promoting better financial planning.

The projectâ€™s main objective is to enhance my Java development skills by implementing key object-oriented principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and file management. The software showcases my understanding of Java syntax and my ability to create an application that handles user data efficiently. Building this program has allowed me to gain deeper insight into designing modular, flexible code in Java.
